        <p>As of April 1, 2020, this new directive sets out the terms and conditions of employment for executives across the core public administration and the associated responsibilities of heads of human resources, delegated managers and executives. The directive covers salary and non-salary elements, performance pay, special deployments and career transition agreements. Employees deployed or appointed (with the exception of acting appointments) to any Executive (EX) Group position on or after April 1, 2020, are subject to the Agreement to being deployed as a condition of employment upon appointment or deployment (Appendix A, Part II, section 14).</p>

            <p>The Performance Management Program for Executives encourages excellence in performance by setting clear objectives, evaluating achievement of results, recognizing and rewarding performance, and providing a framework for consistency in performance management.</p> 
            <p>To reflect the nature and scope of executives’ work, their compensation is different from that of other employees in the core public administration. In addition to base salary, executives may earn performance-based compensation that reflects their level of achievement of objectives and their demonstration of key leadership competencies. Performance-based compensation may be in the form of at-risk pay, inrange salary movement (increments within a salary range) and revision of a salary range. Executives who have achieved exceptional results against all commitments and who have truly demonstrated the Key Leadership Competencies may also receive a bonus.</p>

            <p>Executive talent management is designed to support the ongoing development and retention of executives while supporting current and future departmental business goals. It helps build sustained excellence in public service leadership by maximizing the contribution of every executive. The talent management cycle for EX-01 to EX-03 typically occurs during Winter, while the EX-04 to EX-05 occurs in the Fall</p>
